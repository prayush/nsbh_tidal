Inject Lackey et al model.
Recover with point-particle waveforms.

code convention m2 >= m1

Small range of allowed configurations for injections:
	- 2 <= q <= 5
	- 1.2 <= m1 <= 1.4 (NS)
        NS: 0
	BH: [-0.5, 0.75]

Prior for masses:
	m1_min = m2_min = 1.2
	M_tot_max = 25? (should be large enough to encompass the line of const Mc from the most extreme injection)
	m1_max = 2?
	m2_max = 23?
	all spins allowed?

PK: add amplitude and phase modifications in inject.py
First hardwire Lambda parameter to test
MP: Then include Lambda as a parameter of the likelihood and prior and update post-processing code.
