"Measuring neutron star tidal deformability with Advanced LIGO: a
Bayesian analysis of neutron star - black hole binary observations" by
Prayush Kumasi, Michel Purrer, and Harald Pfeiffer discusses the
effect of tidal interaction between a neutron star and its black hole
companion during binary inspiral, and the imprint this has on the
gravitational waveform produced by the system. The authors address
three questions: (i) whether this effect is strong enough to cause
significant biases in the measurement of other parameters of interest;
(ii) whether this effect is allows us to detect the tidal
deformability of the neutron star (and thereby deduce information
about the nuclear equation of state that determines this parameter);
and (iii) how well the tidal deformability can be measured given a
multitude of observed systems rather than a single system. The paper
is an important extension to previous work in this area by providing a
fully-Bayesian framework for addressing parameter estimation
questions, and by including the effects of multiple observations.
Mixed neutron-star black-hole binaries have not yet been observed
through gravitational waves, but it is likely that they will be quite
soon as LIGO's sensitivity improves, which makes this paper timely.
Furthermore, the impact of the research is quite broad, ranging from
gravitational wave science, to astrophysics, to nuclear physics (since
equation of state measurements probe nuclear physics at the low
temperatures and high densities that exist only in neutron stars).
Therefore I recommend this paper for publication in Physical Review D.

### Comments

#### I. INTRODUCTION

There is perhaps another line of motivation for this work: In order to
produce a SGRB, a system must either be a BNS system with a relatively
soft equation of state, or an NSBH system with a relatively stiff
equation of state. I don't know if there exists a range of EoSs that
allow both BNS and NSBH mergers to produce SGRBs, but it might be
possible that, for sufficiently stiff EoSs, that *all* SGRBs are
produced by NSBH systems. This would have two implications: (i) you
can probably use the known rate density of SGRBs to narrow the range
of NSBH detection rates (though assumptions about the beaming angle
would need to be made) under the hypothesis; and (ii), again under the
hypothesis, you would expect the EoS to be at the stiffer,
more-favorable end. The authors might consider whether this is a
relevant motivation to include.

>> The authors are not aware of literature suggesting "a system must 
either be a BNS system with a relatively soft equation of state, or an 
NSBH system with a relatively stiff equation of state."
 
 
In the introductory paragraph the authors claim that LIGO has made
"the first terrestrial observation of gravitational waves" -- I am not
sure what the meaning of "terrestrial" is in this context (e.g.,
extraterrestrials might have made an earlier observation? or to
distinguish LIGO from pulsar timing arrays, which are at least partly
space-based -- but even so, they have not yet observed gravitational
waves...).

>> By "terrestrial", we meant that the actual measured physical effect of 
gravitational waves (i.e. the change in LIGO's arm lengths) happened on
Earth. In contrast, the observed effect of gravitational wave emission by
binary pulsars on binary pulsars happens at the source (and not on Earth),
since we observe the shrinking of their orbit directly. 
>> However, we appreciate how the term may be somewhat misleading, and 
have replaced it with "direct".


In the third paragraph, a range of black hole masses from 3 to 8 solar
masses is given as the range of masses that allow for disruption of
neutron stars in NSBH systems. However, I think that the upper limit
is considerably higher if the black hole has sufficiently high
prograde spin.

>> Indeed, we have replaced the range with 3-12Msolar as per 
arxiv:1405.1121 for BHs with spinsn up to ~0.9, and added a note on
the dependence of the upper mass limit on BH spin.



In the fifth paragraph, the authors describe the tidal dephasing as
appearing as a 5 PN effect. I would suggest saying that it has a
frequency dependence equivalent to 5 PN effects so the reader might
not think it a GR effect (it is Newtonian).

>> Incorporated.


Also in the fifth paragraph, the authors claim that Fisher matrix
estimates are known to be unreliable at realistic signal-to-noise
ratios. I do not think this is quite so clear cut. It is known that
there are some cases where they are unreliable, and it is known that
there are some cases in which they work just fine. For example, for
BNS systems, it is seen in other work that the Fisher matrix doesn't
do too badly and *that also appears to be true in this work*. I agree
that the Bayesian approach used here is the gold-standard, but I
believe that the authors should probably acknowledge at this point
that their finding shows that the Fisher matrix results were
consistent with their Bayesian results (they state this later).

>> Changed text to acknowledge this:
"Fisher matrix estimates may become unreliable at realistic 
 signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)~\cite{Vallisneri:2007ev}, such as those 
 as we might expect in the upcoming observing runs of GW 
 detectors~\cite{Abadie:2010cf}, and we supplement such studies with 
 a fully Bayesian treatment of the problem here."


In the tenth paragraph, it should be noted that $\chi_{\rm BH}$ is the
*dimensionless* BH spin.

>> Done


#### II. TECHNIQUES

In the first paragraph, of IIA, the sentence beginning "The parameter
space ..." needs to be reworked.

>> Rephrased to:
".. It was calibrated to a suite of $134$ numerical relativity (NR)
 simulations of NSs inspiraling into spinning BHs, with
 NS masses ranging between $1.2M_\odot\leq\mns\leq 1.45M_\odot$,
 mass-ratios $2\leq q\leq 5$, and BH spins $-0.5\leq\chibh\leq+0.75$.
 .."


The exact parameters considered in $\theta$ (and later extended to
$\Theta$) should be made explicit from the beginning. For example, the
masses of the two bodies and the spin of the black hole are explicitly
mentioned. Later the authors describe extrinsic parameters that are
either marginalized over, maximized over, or contribute only to a
normalization and are unnecessary (for a single detector). I think all
this discussion would be clearer if the parameters were made explicit
early on. Parameters might then be divided into a set that is of
interest (masses, spin, tidal parameter) and those that are not
relevant (orientation angles, distance, arrival time, coalescence
phase).

>> 


The authors should indicate up front that they are treating a
single-detector case.

>>


In section IIB -- in footnote 4 perhaps, but preferably more
prominently -- the authors should say what noise curve they are using.
I assume it is aLIGO design: zero-detuning, high-power, and provide a
reference.

>> We have mentioned it in paragraph 7 of the introduction, but
have also added to footnote 4.


In Eq. (3), I believe there is a missing factor of 1/2 in the
exponent.

>> This was an oversight, now corrected.


In Eq. (4), there appears to be extraneous parentheses around "b"
within the integral.

>> Fixed.


#### III. HOW IS PE AFFECTED IF WE IGNORE NS MATTER EFFECTS

In the second paragraph, the authors might consider refining the rates
under the hypothesis that all SGRBs are NSBH events. Assuming 10 / yr
/ Gpc$^3$ SGRBs and some reasonable range of beaming angles, the rate
of events with rho > 20 or rho > 30, and having stiff equation of
states (as required by the hypothesis) should be determinable. See,
e.g., [Chen and Holz
(2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.181101
"Gamma-Ray-Burst Beaming and Gravitational-Wave Observations")

>>


At the end of the second sentence, the authors argue that the
reduction of GW signal power at high frequencies makes the signal
resemble a signal of lower frequency, and therefore of higher mass.
However, an alternative is that the phase evolution (rather than
amplitude) is primarily responsible: the tidal effects sap energy from
the system (both from going into distortion of the neutron star and
into increased GW emission) and this causes the orbit to chirp faster
-- in much the same way an increase in chirp mass would. For NSBH
systems, it is not clear to me whether it is the amplitude effects or
the phase effects that the Bayesian PE is responding to -- probably
both -- but it is worth noting that both of these would cause a bias
toward higher chirp mass.

>> 


#### IV. WHAT DO WE GAIN BY USING TEMPLATES THAT INCLUDE NS MATTER
EFFECTS?

One thing that the authors might consider is relating how parameters
describing the disk mass produced by a disrupted NS relate to the
measurability of the tidal parameter. That is, the subset of systems
that potentially produce SGRBs (i.e., produce a sufficiently large
disk mass) would be the same subset most favorable for measurement of
the tidal parameter. Then the rate of SGRBs would be an indicator of
the rate of events within 100 Mpc (or whatever the range limit for
measurement of the tidal parameter).

>> ??


#### V. COMBINING OBSERVATIONS: LOOKING FORWARD WITH ADVANCED LIGO

Figure 8 (for example) shows a steady improvement in the measurability
of the tidal parameter as observed systems accrue. However, I am
interested in knowing the following: is this improvement in
measurement predominantly due to (a) the few loudest systems measured,
with low-SNR systems adding very little, or (b) the combined effect of
the large number of low-SNR systems. I would encourage the authors to
make a plot of something like Figure 8, but where the posterior is
constructed considering only those systems with SNR > some value. For
example, in the BNS case, [Lackey and Wade
(2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.043002 "Reconstructing
the neutron-star equation of state with gravitational-wave detectors
from a realistic population of inspiralling binary neutron stars")
compares the posteriors for the loudest one, the loudest five, and the
loudest twenty signals. *If* it turns out that measurement requires
intensive NR simulations, it might be relevant to know whether we need
to fully analyze a few single events or the full set of 20+ events.

>> Thank you for the constructive suggestion. We have added a figure
(now Fig.12) where we show how the measurement of NS tidal deformability
improves with the loudest signal first, second-loudest next, and so on.
We also discuss the figure in the Discussion, and hope it addresses
the point brought up above.
