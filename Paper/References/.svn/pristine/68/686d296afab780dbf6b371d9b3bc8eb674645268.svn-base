title = {A spectral multidomain penalty method model for the simulation of high Reynolds number localized incompressible stratified turbulence},
abstract = {A spectral multidomain penalty method model has been developed for the simulation of high Reynolds number localized stratified turbulence. This is the first time that a penalty method, with a particular focus on subdomain interface treatment, has been used with a multidomain scheme to simulate incompressible flows. The temporal discretization ensures maximum temporal accuracy by combining third order stiffly stable and backward differentiation schemes with a high-order boundary condition for the pressure. In the non-periodic vertical direction, a spectral multidomain discretization is used and its stability for under-resolved simulations at high Reynolds numbers is ensured through use of penalty techniques, spectral filtering and strong adaptive interfacial averaging. The penalty method is implemented in different formulations for both the explicit non-linear term advancement and the implicit treatment of the viscous terms. The multidomain model is validated by comparing results of simulations of the mid-to-late time stratified turbulent wake with non-zero net momentum to the corresponding laboratory data for a towed sphere. The model replicates correctly the characteristic vorticity and internal wave structure of the stratified wake and exhibits robust agreement with experiments in terms of the temporal power laws in the evolution of mean profile characteristic velocity and lengthscales.

The continuous equations are discretized using nodal polynomial basis functions of arbitrary order in space on each element of an unstructured computational domain. A fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta scheme is used to advance the solution in time. Methods for introducing artificial damping to control mild nonlinear instabilities are also discussed. The accuracy and convergence of the model with both h (grid size) and p (order) refinement are confirmed for the linearized equations, and calculations are provided for two nonlinear test cases in one horizontal dimension: harmonic generation over a submerged bar, and reflection of a steep solitary wave from a vertical wall. Test cases for two horizontal dimensions will be considered in future work.},

abstract = {We present a high-order nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DG-FEM) solution based on a set of highly accurate Boussinesq-type equations for solving general water-wave problems in complex geometries. A nodal DG-FEM is used for the spatial discretization to solve the Boussinesq equations in complex and curvilinear geometries which amends the application range of previous numerical models that have been based on structured Cartesian grids. The Boussinesq method provides the basis for the accurate description of fully nonlinear and dispersive water waves in both shallow and deep waters within the breaking limit. To demonstrate the current applicability of the model both linear and mildly nonlinear test cases are considered in two horizontal dimensions where the water waves interact with bottom-mounted fully reflecting structures. It is established that, by simple symmetry considerations combined with a mirror principle, it is possible to impose weak slip boundary conditions for both structured and general curvilinear wall boundaries while maintaining the accuracy of the scheme. As is standard for current high-order Boussinesq-type models, arbitrary waves can be generated and absorbed in the interior of the computational domain using a flexible relaxation technique applied on the free surface variables.

Compared with the previous single-domain Fourier PSTD method, this approach allows for an accurate treatment of curved geometries with subdomains, curvilinear mapping, and high-order Chebyshev polynomials. The effectiveness of the algorithm is confirmed by an excellent agreement between the numerical results and analytical solutions for perfectly conducting as well as permeable dielectric cylinders. The algorithm has been applied to model various ground-penetrating radar (GPR) applications involving curved objects in a lossy half space with an undulating surface. This multidomain PSTD algorithm is potentially a very useful tool for simulating antennas near complex objects and inhomogeneous media.},

To overcome well-known problems with polar singularities, we consider the shallow water equations in Cartesian coordinates, augmented with a Lagrange multiplier to ensure that fluid particles are constrained to the spherical surface. The global solutions are represented by a collection of curvilinear quadrilaterals from an icosahedral grid. On each of these elements the local solutions are assumed to be well approximated by a high-order nodal Lagrange polynomial, constructed from a tensor-product of the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points, which also Supplies a high-order quadrature. The shallow water equations are satisfied in a local discontinuous element fashion with solution continuity being enforced weakly. The numerical experiments, involving a comparison of weak and strong conservation forms and the impact of over-integration and filtering, confirm the expected high-order accuracy and the potential for using such highly parallel formulations in numerical weather prediction.

abstract = {We present a convergent high-order accurate scheme for the solution of linear conservation laws in geometrically complex domains. As our main example we include a detailed development and analysis of a scheme for the time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations in a three-dimensional domain. The fully unstructured spatial discretization is made possible by the use of a high-order nodal basis, employing multivariate Lagrange polynomials defined on the triangles and tetrahedra, while the equations themselves are satisfied in a discontinuous Galerkin form with the boundary conditions being enforced weakly through a penalty term. Accuracy, stability, and convergence of the semidiscrete approximation to Maxwell's equations is established rigorously and bounds on the growth of the global divergence error are provided. Concerns related to efficient implementations are discussed in detail. This sets the stage for the presentation of examples, verifying the theoretical results, and illustrating the versatility, flexibility, and robustness when solving two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems in computational electromagnetics. Pure scattering as well as penetration is discussed and high parallel performance of the scheme is demonstrated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {The Maxwell eigenvalue problem is known to pose difficulties for standard numerical methods, predominantly due to its large null space. As an alternative to the widespread use of Galerkin finite-element methods based on curl-conforming elements, we propose to use high-order nodal elements in a discontinuous element scheme.We consider both two- and three-dimensional problems and show the former to be without problems in a wide range of cases. Numerical experiments suggest the validity of this for general problems. For the three-dimensional eigenproblem, we encounter difficulties with a naive formulation of the scheme and propose minor modifications, intimately related to the discontinuous nature of the formulation, to overcome these concerns. We conclude by connecting the findings to time domain solution of Maxwell's equations.The discussion, analysis, and numerous computational experiments suggest that using discontinuous element schemes for solving Maxwell's equation in the frequency or time-domain present a high-order accurate, efficient and robust alternative to classical Galerkin finite-element methods.},

title = {High-order nodal discontinuous Galerkin particle-in-cell method on unstructured grids},
abstract = {We present a high-order particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm for the simulation of kinetic plasmas dynamics. The core of the algorithm utilizes an unstructured grid discontinuous Galerkin Maxwell field solver combining high-order accuracy with geometric flexibility. We introduce algorithms in the Lagrangian framework that preserve the favorable properties of the field solver in the PIC solver. Fast full-order interpolation and effective search algorithms are used for tracking individual particles on the general grid and smooth particle shape functions are introduced to ensure low noise in the charge and current density. A pre-computed levelset distance function is employed to represent the geometry and facilitates complex particle-boundary interaction. To enforce charge conservation we consider two different techniques, one based on projection and one on hyperbolic cleaning. Both are found to work well, although the latter is found be too expensive when used with explicit time integration. Examples of simple plasma phenomena, e.g., plasma waves, instabilities, and Landau damping are shown to agree well with theoretical predictions and/or results found by other computational methods. We also discuss generic well known problems such as numerical Cherenkov radiation and grid heating before presenting a few two-dimensional tests, showing the potential of the current method to handle fully relativistic plasma dynamics in complex geometries. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Despite the popularity of high-order explicit Runge-Kutta (ERK) methods for integrating semi-discrete systems of equations, ERK methods suffer from severe stability-based time step restrictions for very stiff problems. We implement a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM) along with recently introduced high-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) schemes to overcome geometry-induced stiffness in fluid-flow problems. The IMEX algorithms solve the non-stiff portions of the domain using explicit methods, and isolate and solve the more expensive stiff portions using an L-stable, stiffly-accurate explicit, singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method (ESDIRK). Furthermore, we apply adaptive time-step controllers based on the embedded temporal error predictors. We demonstrate in a number of numerical test problems that IMEX methods in conjunction with efficient preconditioning become more efficient than explicit methods for systems exhibiting high levels of grid-induced stiffness.

The resulting Reduced Navier-Stokes (RNS) equations are defined on the boundary of the flow, and hence have reduced spatial dimensionality compared to the Navier-Stokes equations. This spatial reduction speeds up numerical computations and makes the equations attractive candidates for flow-control design. We prove that members of the RNS hierarchy are well-posed if appended with boundary-conditions obtained from wall-based sensors. We also derive the lowest-order RNS equations for three-dimensional flows. For several benchmark problems, our numerical simulations show close finite-time agreement between the solutions of RNS and those of the full Navier-Stokes equations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

title = {A multi-domain Chebyshev collocation method for predicting ultrasonic field parameters in complex material geometries},
abstract = {The use of ultrasound to measure elastic field parameters as well as to detect cracks in solid materials has received much attention, and new important applications have been developed recently, e.g., the use of laser generated ultrasound in non-destructive evaluation (NDE). To model such applications requires a realistic calculation of field parameters in complex geometries with discontinuous, layered materials.In this paper we present an approach for solving the elastic wave equation in complex geometries with discontinuous layered materials. The approach is based on a pseudospectral elastodynamic formulation, giving a direct solution of the time-domain elastodynamic equations. A typical calculation is performed by decomposing the global computational domain into a number of subdomains. Every subdomain is then mapped on a unit square using transfinite blending functions and spatial derivatives are calculated efficiently by a Chebyshev collocation scheme. This enables that the elastodynamic equations can be solved within spectral accuracy, and furthermore, complex interfaces can be approximated smoothly, hence avoiding staircasing. A global solution is constructed from the local solutions by means of characteristic variables. Finally, the global solution is advanced in time using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme. Examples of field prediction in discontinuous solids with complex geometries are given and related to ultrasonic NDE. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = { In this paper, we study the local discontinuous {Galerkin} (LDG) methods for nonlinear, time-dependent convection-diffusion systems. These methods are an extension of the Runge--Kutta discontinuous {Galerkin} (RKDG) methods for purely hyperbolic systems to convection-diffusion systems and share with those methods their high parallelizability, high-order formal accuracy, and easy handling of complicated geometries for convection-dominated problems. It is proven that for scalar equations, the LDG methods are L2-stable in the nonlinear case. Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods. Preliminary numerical examples displaying the performance of the method are shown.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews some known and proposes some new preconditioning
	methods for a number of discontinuous Galerkin (or DG) finite element
	approximations for elliptic problems of second order. Nested hierarchy
	of meshes is generally assumed. Our approach utilizes a general two-level
	scheme, where the finite element space for the DG method is decomposed
	into a subspace (viewed as an auxiliary or lsquocoarsersquo space),
	plus a correction which can be handled by a standard smoothing procedure.
	We consider three different auxiliary subspaces, namely, piecewise
	linear C0-conforming functions, piecewise linear functions that are
	continuous at the centroids of the edges/faces (Crouzeix-Raviart
	finite elements) and piecewise constant functions over the finite
	elements. To support the theoretical results, we also present numerical
	experiments for 3-D model problem showing uniform convergence of
	the constructed methods.},
